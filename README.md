# Offline voice controlled wheelchair
This project is all about making a voice-controlled wheelchair. It’s designed to help people with physical disabilities move around more easily and independently. The wheelchair uses the VC02 AI Thinker module for voice recognition. This means users can control the wheelchair just by talking, and it doesn't need the connectivity to do this. The VC02 module also works with a microcontroller to manage the wheelchair's motors and to see obstacles using ultrasonic sensors. We're focusing on making it responsive and reliable. There’s an an obstacle detection system to help avoid crashes, which keeps users safe while they drive. These features combine to create an easy, hands-free way to control the wheelchair .We aim to blend advanced technology with a budget-friendly design. This approach should make it easier for people to use the wheelchair and help them move around without straining themselves. Ultimately, this gives them more freedom in their everyday lives.
